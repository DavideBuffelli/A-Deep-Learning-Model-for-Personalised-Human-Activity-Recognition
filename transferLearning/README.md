# Custom DeepSense Model

The idea behind this model is to exploit transfer learning to adapt the DeepSense framework to a specific user.
In particular the idea is to separate the output layer of the original DeepSense model from the rest
of the framework and to train it with new examples generated by the user. More details can be found 
in my [thesis](http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/62146/) (chapter 4).
